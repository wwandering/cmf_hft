Trading simulator and Stoikov's paper algorithm tested on it. 
Implemented during CMF Hardcore Labs' course on market making to conceptually understand basics of market trading with a flavour of market-making.

## Notes
- Data was presented by Hardcore Labs: BTC/USDT & ETH/USDT order book from Binance. Currently, the data is lost due to external reasons (mostly Slack policy).
- Stoikov's algorithm backtesting is based on other's student simulator (for sake of uniformity) with a bit of enhancements, but implementation is similar and is done by following the same idea.
